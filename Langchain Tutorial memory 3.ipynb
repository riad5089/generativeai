In a whirlwind investigation, he linked a suspicious glitch in the gallery's security system, an unusually jittery night watchman, and an enigmatic foreign buyer showing keen interest in the artwork. Delving deeper, Marlowe discovered the portrait concealed a map to a lost treasure, which led him to an underground art-smuggling ring. With skillful sleuthing and relentless determination, Marlowe solved the mystery, brought the criminals to justice, and ensured the priceless artwork was rightfully restored.\n"
